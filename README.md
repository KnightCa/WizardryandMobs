# Wizardry and Mobs
A Minecraft 1.12.2 modpack that includes Electroblob's Wizardry and a variety of fantasy mods.

[Wizardry and Mobs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/wizardry-and-mobs) mostly consists of the various magic mods compatible with Electroblob Wizardry, a variety of monster mods (including Lycanites and Fire & Ice Dragons) to add a challenge, and a few adventure mods to provide new places to explore. It was created because there is need for a modpack to combine these options. There is a large community of Minecraft players who would love to combine their love of magic with their love of a challenge, and this modpack is for them!
